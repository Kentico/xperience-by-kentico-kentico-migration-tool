## Migration Protocol Reference

Running the `Migration.Toolkit.CLI.exe migrate` command (
see [`Migration.Toolkit.CLI/README.md`](/Migration.Toolkit.CLI/README.md)) generates a **migration protocol file**. The
protocol provides information about the result of the migration, lists required manual steps, etc.

You can find the protocol file in the location specified by
the `Settings.MigrationProtocolPath` [configuration option](/Migration.Toolkit.CLI/README.md#Configuration).

## Common Migration Protocol Warnings & Errors

| Message ReferenceName                                       | Severity    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| BulkCopyColumnMismatch                                      | Error       | For performance optimization, the migration transfers certain objects using bulk SQL queries. The columns in the related database tables must match on the source and target. The migration attempts to discard data from extra columns on the source.<br /><br />**Fix**: Review the tables for customizations on the source instance and revert/update the schema to match the default Kentico Xperience 13 state. |
| CmsClass_CmsRootClassTypeSkip                               | Information | 'CMS.Root' is a special system page type and is not supported for migration.<br /><br />**Fix**: No actions required. Xperience by Kentico contains a root page type by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| CmsTree_TreeIsLinkFromDifferentSite                         | Warning     | The content tree contains a page that is linked from a different site. Linked pages from other sites are not supported for migration (Xperience by Kentico currently does not allow multiple sites). <br /><br />**Fix**: Remove the linked page on the source instance or create a copy that is not linked from a different site.                                                                                   |
| CmsUser_SkipAdminUser                                       | Warning     | Migration of the 'administrator' user was not processed.<br /><br />**Fix**: Remove the 'administrator' user on the target instances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| CmsUser_SkipPublicUser                                      | Warning     | Migration of the system 'public' user was not processed.<br /><br />**Fix**: No actions required. All bindings (e.g. the site binding) for the 'public' user account will be mapped automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| CustomFormComponent                                         | Warning     | Logged when Page Builder content on the source instance contains a property using a custom form component (one that doesn't exist in the default installation). You need to manually create a corresponding component suitable for Xperience by Kentico on the target instance.                                                                                                                                      |
| DataMustNotExistInTargetInstanceTable                       | Warning     | Occurs when data is present for objects migrated using bulk SQL queries (for performance optimization, for example the Contact management migration).<br /><br />**Fix**: You always need to delete all objects of the given types before running repeated migrations.                                                                                                                                               |
| DbConstraintBroken                                          | Error       | General error message indicating that the target database cannot hold migrated data, due to duplicate values in unique columns (e.g., primary keys) or due to a missing dependency.<br /><br />**Fix**: Manually migrate the object (specified object by the ID in the message), or check if dependencies required by the object were successfully migrated.                                                         |
| EntityExplicitlyExcludedByCodeName                          | Warning     | The object is excluded via the `Settings.EntityConfigurations.<object table name>.ExcludeCodeNames` configuration option.<br /><br />**Fix**: If you wish to migrate the object, remove the given code name from the configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ErrorSavingTargetInstance                                   | Error       | A general error that prevents data from being saved in the target Xperience by Kentico database. For example, can be caused by a database timeout or temporary outage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| FailedToCreateTargetInstance                                | Error       | General error when the creation of the target entity failed. Can be caused by a problem with the source data or by an error in the Migration toolkit.<br /><br />**Fix**: Check if the related source data is compatible with the target or report a Migration toolkit issue.                                                                                                                                        |
| FailedToUpdateTargetInstance / FailedToUpdateTargetInstance | Error       | General error when updating / inserting an object on the target instance.<br /><br />**Fix**: Depends on the details in the error message. Can have various causes, such as an interrupted database connection or malformed/incorrect data.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| FormComponentNotSupportedInLegacyMode                       | Warning     | Logged when Page Builder content on the source instance contains a property using a form component that is not supported by the Page Builder legacy mode in Xperience by Kentico.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
