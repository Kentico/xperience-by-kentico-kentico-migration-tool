# Migration Tool customization

To create custom migrations:

1. Create the custom migration class:
    - [Field migrations](#customize-field-migrations)
    - [Widget migrations](#customize-widget-migrations)
    - [Widget property migrations](#customize-widget-property-migrations)
    - [Custom class mappings](#custom-class-mappings)
2. [Register the migration](#register-migrations)

## Customize field migrations

You can customize field migrations to customize the default mappings of fields of page types, modules, system objects, and forms. In the `Migration.Tool.Extensions/CommunityMigrations` folder, create a new file with a class that implements the `IFieldMigration` interface. Implement the following properties and methods required by the interface:

- `Rank` - An integer property that determines the order in which migrations are applied. Use a value lower than *100000*, as that is the value for system migrations.
- `ShallMigrate` - A boolean method that specifies whether the migration shall be applied for the current field. Use properties of the `FieldMigrationContext` object passed as an argument to the method to evaluate the condition. For each field, the migration with the lowest rank that returns `true` from the `ShallMigrate` method is used.
  - `SourceDataType` - A string property that specifies the [data type](https://docs.kentico.com/x/coJwCg) of the source field.
  - `SourceFormControl` - A string property that specifies the [form control](https://docs.kentico.com/x/lAyRBg) used by the source field.
  - `FieldName` - A string property that specifies the code name of the field.
  - `SourceObjectContext` - An interface that can be used to check the context of the source object (e.g. page vs. form).
- `MigrateFieldDefinition` - Migrate the definition of the field. Use the `XElement` attribute to transform the field.
- `MigrateValue` - Migrate the value of the field. Use the source value and the `FieldMigrationContext` with the same parameters as described in `ShallMigrate`.

You can see samples:

- [SampleTextMigration.cs](./CommunityMigrations/SampleTextMigration.cs)
  - A sample migration with further explanations
- [AssetMigration.cs](./DefaultMigrations/AssetMigration.cs)
  - An example of a usable migration

After implementing the migration, you need to [register the migration](#register-migrations) in the system.

## Customize widget migrations

You can customize widget migration to change the widget to which source widgets are migrated in the target instance. In the `Migration.Tool.Extensions/CommunityMigrations` folder, create a new file with a class that implements the `IWidgetMigration` interface. Implement the following properties and methods required by the interface:

- `Rank` - An integer property that determines the order in which migrations are applied. Use a value lower than *100000*, as that is the value for system migrations.
- `ShallMigrate` - A boolean method that specifies whether the migration shall be applied for the current widget. Use properties of the `WidgetMigrationContext` and `WidgetIdentifier` objects passed as an argument to the method to evaluate the condition. For each widget, the migration with the lowest rank that returns `true` from the `ShallMigrate` method is used.
  - `WidgetMigrationContext.SiteId` - An integer property that specifies the ID of the site on which the widget was used in the source instance.
  - `WidgetIdentifier.TypeIdentifier` - A string property that specifies the identifier of the widget.
- `MigrateWidget`- Migrate the widget data using the following properties:
  - `identifier` - A `WidgetIdentifier` object, see `ShallMigrate` to see properties.
  - `value` - A `JToken` object containing the deserialized value of the property.
  - `context` - A `WidgetMigrationContext` object, see `ShallMigrate` to see properties.

You can see a sample: [SampleWidgetMigration.cs](./CommunityMigrations/SampleWidgetMigration.cs)

After implementing the migration, you need to [register the migration](#register-migrations) in the system.

## Customize widget property migrations

In the `Migration.Tool.Extensions/CommunityMigrations` folder, create a new file with a class that implements the `IWidgetPropertyMigration` interface. Implement the following properties and methods required by the interface:

- `Rank` - An integer property that determines the order in which migrations are applied. Use a value lower than *100000*, as that is the value for system migrations.
- `ShallMigrate` - A boolean method that specifies whether the migration shall be applied for the current widget. Use properties of the `WidgetPropertyMigrationContext` and `propertyName` objects passed as an argument to the method to evaluate the condition. For each widget property, the migration with the lowest rank that returns `true` from the `ShallMigrate` method is used.
  - `WidgetPropertyMigrationContext.SiteId` - An integer property that specifies the ID of the site on which the widget was used in the source instance.
  - `WidgetPropertyMigrationContext.EditingFormControlModel` - An object representing the [form control](https://docs.kentico.com/x/lAyRBg) of the property.
  - `propertyName` - A string property that specifies the identifier of the property.
- `MigrateWidgetProperty`- Migrate the widget property data using the following properties:
  - `key` - Name of the property.
  - `value` - A `JToken` object containing the deserialized value of the property.
  - `context` - A `WidgetPropertyMigrationContext`. See `ShallMigrate` method to see the properties.

You can see samples:

- [Path selector migration](./DefaultMigrations/WidgetPathSelectorMigration.cs)
- [Page selector migration](./DefaultMigrations/WidgetPageSelectorMigration.cs)
- [File selector migration](./DefaultMigrations/WidgetFileMigration.cs)

After implementing the migration, you need to [register the migration](#register-migrations) in the system.

## Custom class mappings

You can customize class mappings to adjust the content model between the source instance and the target Xperience by Kentico instance. For example, you can merge multiple page types into a single content type, or migrate specific page types to the [content hub](https://docs.kentico.com/x/barWCQ) as reusable content.

1. Create a new class.
2. Define a new `MultiClassMapping` object:

    ```csharp
    var m = new MultiClassMapping(targetClassName, target =>
    {
      // Target content type name
      target.ClassName = "Acme.Event";
      // Database table name of the new type
      target.ClassTableName = "Acme_Event";
      // Display name of the content type
      target.ClassDisplayName = "My new transformed event";
      // Type of the class (specifies that the class is a content type)
      target.ClassType = ClassType.CONTENT_TYPE;
      // Use of the content type
      target.ClassContentTypeType = ClassContentTypeType.WEBSITE;
    });
    ```

3. Define a new primary key:

    ```csharp
    m.BuildField("EventID").AsPrimaryKey();
    ```

4. Define individual fields of the new content type:

    ```csharp
    // Build a new title field
    var title = m.BuildField("Title");

    // Map "EventTitle" field form source data class "_ET.Event1"
    // Set the isTemplate parameter to 'true' to inherit the definition
    // of the source field as a template
    title.SetFrom("_ET.Event1", "EventTitle", true);
    // Map "EventTitle" field form a second source data class "_ET.Event2"
    // The isTemplate is not set, so only the value is taken from this source
    title.SetFrom("_ET.Event2", "EventTitle");
    // You can modify the field definition, e.g., change the caption of the field
    title.WithFieldPatch(f => f.Caption = "Event title");
    ```

5. (*Optional*) You can add custom value conversions:

    ```csharp
    var startDate = m.BuildField("StartDate");
    startDate.SetFrom("_ET.Event1", "EventDateStart", true);
    // Use value conversion to modify the field value
    startDate.ConvertFrom("_ET.Event2", "EventStartDateAsText", false,
        (v, context) =>
        {
            switch (context)
            {
                case ConvertorTreeNodeContext treeNodeContext:
                    // You can use the available TreeNode context here
                    // (var nodeGuid, int nodeSiteId, int? documentId, bool migratingFromVersionHistory) = treeNodeContext;
                    break;
                default:
                    // No context is available (possibly when tool is extended with other conversion possibilities)
                    break;
            }

            return v?.ToString() is { } av && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(av) ? DateTime.Parse(av) : null;
        });
    startDate.WithFieldPatch(f => f.Caption = "Event start date");
    ```

1. Register the class mapping to the dependency injection container:

    ```csharp
    serviceCollection.AddSingleton<IClassMapping>(m);
    ```

After implementing the custom mapping, you need to [register the mapping](#register-migrations) in the system.

### Examples

You can find sample class mappings in the [ClassMappingSample.cs](/Migration.Tool.Extensions/ClassMappings/ClassMappingSample.cs) file.

- `AddSimpleRemodelingSample` showcases how to change the mapping of a single page type
- `AddClassMergeSample` showcases how to merge two page types into a single content type
- `AddReusableRemodelingSample` showcases how to migrate a page type as reusable content

## Register migrations

Register the migration in `Migration.Tool.Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` as a `Transient` dependency into the service collection:

- Field migrations - `services.AddTransient<IFieldMigration, MyFieldMigration>();`
- Widget migrations - `services.AddTransient<IWidgetMigration, MyWidgetMigration>();`
- Widget property migrations - `services.AddTransient<IWidgetPropertyMigration, MyWidgetPropertyMigration>();`
- Custom class mappings - `services.AddMyCustomMapping();`
