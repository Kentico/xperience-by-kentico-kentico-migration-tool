# Handler for legacy attachment URLs

Page attachments are not supported in Xperience by Kentico. Instead, the [Migration tool](/README.md) transfers
attachment files into [media libraries](https://docs.xperience.io/x/agKiCQ).

Any attachment files in the content of pages migrated from the source instance (KX13/K12) still use the old attachment
handler URLs and will no longer work (return 404 errors). For example, this can include images and file download links.
If you wish to continue using these legacy attachment URLs, you need
to [add a custom handler](#add-the-handler-to-your-project) to your Xperience by Kentico project.

## Prerequisite

To ensure that the handler provided in the `LegacyAttachmentHandler.cs` file works correctly, you need to [migrate](/Migration.Tool.CLI/README.md) your page attachments into a **media library** using the `MigrateMediaToMediaLibrary` configuration option, and **keep the default folder structure and file names**. By default, attachments are migrated into the content hub and the handler is not applicable.

### Attachment URLs in content

The `LegacyAttachmentHandler.cs` handler can serve the following legacy attachment URLs:

- `/getimage/[AttachmentGUID]/[AttachmentName].[AttachmentExtension]`
  - Example: `/getimage/454BD7D7-200F-4976-AD21-8B5D70CBE7FD/image.jpg`
- `/getattachment/[NodeAliasPath]/[AttachmentName].[AttachmentExtension]`
  - Example: `/getattachment/news/article1/image.jpg`
- `/getattachment/[AttachmentGUID]/[AttachmentName].[AttachmentExtension]`
  - Example: `/getattachment/454BD7D7-200F-4976-AD21-8B5D70CBE7FD/image.jpg`

## Add the handler to your project

1. Open your Xperience by Kentico solution in Visual Studio.
2. Add a custom assembly (_Class Library_ project) to your solution or re-use an existing one. See
   the [Integrate custom code](https://docs.xperience.io/x/QoXWCQ) documentation for details.
3. Copy the `[Migration tool repository]\Migration.Tool.KXP.Extensions\LegacyAttachmentHandler.cs` file into your
   custom class library.
4. Change the default `Migration.Tool.KXP.Extensions` namespace in the class's code to fit your project and company.
5. Rebuild your Xperience by Kentico solution.

The handler now processes legacy attachment URLs in your website's migrated content and returns matching media library
files.
